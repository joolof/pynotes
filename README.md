# PyNotes

Simple command line tool to take notes. Notes are saved as markdown files, located at {$HOME}/.pynotes (the directory will be created if it doesn't exist).

## Installation and tweaks

In ` ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/npyscreen/wgmultiline.py` I had to edit line 447 to unbind the shortcut `n` as I wanted to use it for adding a new entry.
